## Let's build a simple app
- An application to manage courses
- Courses will have 1 or more lessons
- Lessons will have 1 or more questions
- We will have students and teachers
- Teachers can create courses and lessons
- Students can create questions in lessons
- We will need a homepage that will show the available courses and from there users will be able to look at the course contents and sign up.
